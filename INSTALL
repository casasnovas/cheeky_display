To install this driver correctly, just do the folowing:
  $ make
As root:
  $ make install
The install command creates a udev rule to make the char device /dev/cheeky[0-9]*
group owned by the cheeky group. After the installation, if you want to use the
helper programme cheeky_control (or to control the cheeky char device with another
programm), make sure your user is a member of the cheeky group, to do so:
  $ gpasswd -a USER cheeky
You are now ready to plug your led display device. A new char device will be
created and you can manage it thanks to the helper programm cheeky_control, which
should be present at the root of the project (see README or cheeky_control --help
to see the documentation).

  $ emacs /etc/rc.conf	# Don't edit with vi/vim... it sucks ;)

other modules that are loaded at boot time.

Gentoo:
As root add a line to the file /etc/modules.autoload/kernel-2.6 containing
'cheeky_driver':
  $ echo 'cheeky_driver' >> /etc/modules.autoload/kernel-2.6

Debian/Ubuntu:
As root add a line to the file /etc/modules containing 'cheeky_driver':
  $ echo 'cheeky_driver' >> /etc/modules


Fedora/RedHat/CentOS/Mandrake/Mandriva:
As root add a line to the file /etc/modules.conf containing 'cheeky_driver'
  $ echo 'cheeky_driver' >> /etc/rc.modules
